  ######  I've decided to change my tool (phaser) to Kaboom to create a dinsour game that is like mario for my sep11 freedom project. I made this change because no one was really using phaser as a tool and I know I will need help in the future using my tool and Kaboom has a bunch of users. In additon, Kamboom is a very good tool to use for these type of games.

  ### Tinkering

  ##### I have been tinkering with Kaboom.js in my ide. I did the process of downloading kamboom onto my computer and all those steps. This made it easier to code since now my computer undertsand what im telling it to do. However, i am having trouble with the code doing what i want it to do.
