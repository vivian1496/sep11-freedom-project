My first experience with my tool was downloading it to my computer. This process was very easy however trying to make the code work was the difficult part.
   I would input a code that can make my given spirte jump when a certained key is pressed


                             onKeyPress("space", () => {
                              if (bean.isGrounded()) {
                              bean.jump(); }
                                            });


   but when i ran the code, absoluetly nothing happened. I tried refreshing the page but it still wouldn't show. I went to kamboom and checked the tutorial out, i noticed that it said you should start out with kaboom() so i deleted all the other code that came from the instalation and added kamboom (). Then i added all the other code that adds the sprite to the page and positoned it. To make sure this code worked i ran it, when i saw that that worked i decided to go with that
